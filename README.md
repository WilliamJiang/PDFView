Quick Start
============

This app is available for `ios`. `android` version does not tested yet. 
To start the app, using following command:
 
```bash
$ react-native run-ios
```


The 3rd library used
---------------------

- react-native-fs
- react-native-pdf-view

In MacBook `XCode` I imported the .xcodeproj file to build a working version for PDF view. Some extra works are needed in `native` codes like C#/Java/Swift to integrate with `React Native`.
